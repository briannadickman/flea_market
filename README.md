# Flea Market 
#### Group Full-Stack project

Full-stack application using the MEAN stack that randomly generates prices for 3 categories of items. Users can buy and sell these items, with the aim of increasing the overall balance they have available.

## Getting Started

Clone or download this repository to get started using the Flea-Market game.

### Prerequisites & Installing

To get started using Flea-Market, you will need to make sure you have the latest versions of MongoDB, mongoose, Angular.js, Node.js, Express.js, and Bootstrap. To download these or make sure you are up to date, open terminal, navigate to the folder containing the app and type:

```
npm install
```

This will automatically install all the dependencies the application has. To start and run the application, type:

```
npm start
```

And navigate to localhost:5000. 

Voila! You are now able to play Flea Market!

Spend a minute to observe the prices changing at consistent time intervals. Purchase an item by clicking "buy" when the price is low, and "Sell" when the price is high to increase your overall balance!
